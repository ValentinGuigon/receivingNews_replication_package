I did make a second, more academic version of the models, in which I removed :
- The random effects of Year and Group, since 
	they only have 2 levels each, 
	no difference was found between groups and years (except WTP), 
	and the nested version (1|Year/Group), which gives 4 levels, still had a variance of 0.

- The random effects of order, 
	which consistently had a variance of 0
As a result, the subject random effects gain a sufficiently high variance

- I also removed the subject random effects in the success models, 
	since the variance is systematically 0, probably because the subjects are very close in terms of success. 

As a result, the second version of the success models is a fixed model and not a mixed model.

The .R and .RData files for these models end by _rand2.
